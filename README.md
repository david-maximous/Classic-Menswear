# Classic Menswear

This was a group project for Introduction to Web Programming Module in BUE Prep Year
It was required not to use any frameworks or templates

I used native HTML, CSS, and JS. Also some libraries as Font Awesome, and jQuery.
The font family that was used is Oswald

It's not responsive since I couldn't use Bootstrap but I hope you Like it

You're free to use or develop it, but metion the source of it !
